# Treehouse Soul Document

## Core Philosophy

**"The curriculum is your actual life."**

We're not a chore app. We're not a gamification layer. We're a childhood development tool wearing game clothes.

### The Real Lessons

| Surface | Soul |
|---------|------|
| Streaks | "When you fall, get back up" - not "never miss" |
| Points | Feedback on growth, not currency to spend |
| Leaderboards | Personal progress, not family competition |
| Chores | Executive function training, autonomy building |
| Conflicts | Skill development opportunities |

### Anti-Patterns (Never Do)

- Public shame / visible failures
- Points as currency (buy stuff)
- Zero-sum competition (I win = you lose)
- Anxiety-inducing streaks
- Parent surveillance vibes
- Hollow badge collecting

---

## Key Mechanics

### 1. Forgiving Streaks

The discipline lesson isn't perfection - it's resilience.

- Built-in rest days (1-2/week guilt-free)
- "Bounce back" celebration for returns (prodigal son mechanic)
- Monthly consistency > daily perfection
- Track: current streak + best streak + comeback count
- No purchasable streak freezes

### 2. Growth RPG Stats

Kids have character stats that level up through different activities.

**Hybrid naming** - Fantasy terms that map to real skills (can display either):

```
FANTASY        REAL-WORLD           WHAT IT MEANS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
💪 Strength    Grit/Resilience      Doing hard things, pushing through
🧠 Wisdom      Self-Awareness       Reflection, learning from mistakes
❤️  Heart      Empathy/Kindness     Helping others, compassion
⚡ Dexterity   Initiative           Acting without being asked
🎯 Focus       Executive Function   Completing tasks, follow-through
🤝 Charisma    Collaboration        Teamwork, family contribution
```

- Different activities level different stats
- Parents OR kids can select focus areas
- No "bad" builds - celebrate different strengths
- **Visual character/avatar that evolves** (very important)
- Sibling stat visibility: TBD (needs thought - competition risk)

### 3. Avatar/Character System (Important)

Identity and self-expression are crucial for 10-16 year olds.

**Core concept:** Your character visually evolves with your growth.

**Elements:**
- Base character customization (appearance, style)
- Visual evolution as overall level increases
- Stats reflected in character (high Heart = warm glow? high Focus = sharp eyes?)
- Cosmetic unlocks through growth milestones (NOT purchases)
- Possible "archetypes" emerge from stat distribution

**Archetypes (based on dominant stats):**
```
THE HELPER     - High Heart + Teamwork
THE SCHOLAR    - High Wisdom + Focus
THE SPARK      - High Initiative + Dexterity
THE ROCK       - High Strength/Grit + Focus
THE CONNECTOR  - High Charisma + Heart
```

**What levels unlock:**
- New character features/styles (not power, just expression)
- Titles that reflect growth ("The Resilient", "Quick Starter")
- Environment/background changes
- NOT functional advantages, NOT purchasable items

**Art Style Decision: Abstract/Geometric**
- Realistic without commissioned artwork
- Procedurally generate variations
- Modern, not babyish (important for 10-16)
- Think: Monument Valley, minimalist character builders
- Distinctive - stands out from cartoon chore apps

**Visual Progression by Level:**
```
Level 1-5 (Sprout):
- Basic geometric shape
- 2-3 expressions
- 3 color options
- Empty background
- Basic title

Level 6-10 (Growing):
- + Accessories (geometric additions)
- + More shape variations
- + 5 more colors
- + Simple background
- + Stat-based titles

Level 11-20 (Flourishing):
- + Outfit patterns
- + Stat-influenced glow/aura
- + Weather/time backgrounds
- + Archetype emerges
- + More complex shapes

Level 21-30 (Thriving):
- + Particle effects
- + Companions (small geometric creatures?)
- + Full environmental scenes
- + Seasonal variations
- + Legacy items (mark of achievement)
```

**Stat-Influenced Visuals:**
- High Heart: warm glow, soft edges, heart motifs
- High Focus: sharp lines, target motifs, clear definition
- High Strength: sturdy base, grounded stance, mountain shapes
- High Wisdom: contemplative pose, subtle shimmer, scroll/book motifs
- High Initiative: dynamic angles, lightning accents, forward lean
- High Charisma: radiating lines, connected shapes, bridge motifs

**Design Principles:**
1. Growth is visible at a glance
2. Stats show visually, not just numbers
3. No "better" looks - different builds = different aesthetics
4. Earned through growth, NEVER purchased
5. Personal journey, not competitive display

### 4. Family 360 System

**Kudos Flow:**
- Any family member can recognize any other
- "I noticed Emma helped without being asked" → ⚡ Initiative XP
- Weekly kudos summary for whole family
- Parents can give, kids can give (to siblings AND parents)

**Growth Opportunities (not "fights"):**
- Conflicts get logged by **parent OR kid self-report** (both can initiate)
- Reframed as skill-building moments, not punishment
- Triggers: journal prompt, reflection, discussion guide
- Skills developed: conflict resolution, truth-telling, emotional regulation
- Turn "you're in trouble" → "here's something to work on"
- Kid self-report = extra Wisdom XP (metacognition!)

### 5. Reflection Layer

**Daily Check-in (60 sec, optional):**
- How was today? (mood)
- One thing I'm proud of
- Something that was hard
- Tomorrow I want to...

**Post-Conflict Reflection:**
- What happened?
- How did I feel?
- What could I do differently?
- What skill am I building?

**Weekly Family Wins:**
- Aggregate view of family growth
- Cooperative framing ("we did X together")
- Conversation starter for family dinner

---

## Target User

**Age: 10-16**
- Has own device
- Developing identity
- Wants autonomy
- Can think abstractly about growth
- Executive function still developing

**Not surveillance for parents. Growth tool for kids.**

---

## Success Metric

**The app worked if the kid eventually doesn't need it.**

They've internalized:
- Showing up consistently
- Recovering from setbacks
- Reflecting on actions
- Self-awareness of strengths/growth areas

---

## Open Questions

### Resolved
- ~~Avatar/character system - how deep?~~ → Very important, geometric/abstract style, deep progression
- ~~Conflict logging - who can initiate?~~ → Both parent AND kid (self-report gets bonus Wisdom XP)
- ~~What do "levels" unlock?~~ → Cosmetic expression only, never functional advantages
- ~~Stat naming?~~ → Hybrid: fantasy names that map to real skills, show either/both
- ~~Parent visibility into journals?~~ → See Journal Privacy below
- ~~Sibling visibility / weaponization?~~ → Can't fully control, just don't facilitate or incentivize
- ~~ADHD mode?~~ → Not a v1 priority, keep in mind but don't let it block progress

### Still Open
1. **Social/friend features** - Family-only or expand to friends? (v2+ probably)
2. **Onboarding flow** - Parent-first or kid-first? Who sets up the family?
3. **Graduation ceremony** - What does "you don't need us anymore" look like?
4. **MVP scope** - What's the smallest thing that embodies this soul?

---

## Journal Privacy (Resolved)

Parent chooses during setup:

**Option A: AI Summary Mode (Recommended)**
- Kid journals privately
- AI flags patterns: "general anxiety", "sibling conflict", "depressive tendencies", "doing great"
- Parent gets periodic summary, not raw content
- Encourages kid honesty

**Option B: Full Visibility**
- Parent can read everything
- Still gets AI summary
- Kid knows parent can see

**Emergency "Break Glass"**
- Parent can always access raw content if safety concern
- Logged/visible that access happened
- For genuine emergencies, not surveillance

**Philosophy:** Default toward privacy to encourage honesty. Trust but verify through AI patterns.

---

## Sibling Dynamics (Resolved)

**Reality check:** Kids will create competition. Kids will be dicks. Kids will weaponize anything.

**Our job:** Don't facilitate or incentivize bad behavior. Accept we can't prevent all misuse.

**Practical:**
- Don't show comparative stats by default
- Kudos require substance, not just "Jake sucks"
- Conflict reports need context, not just accusations
- If gaming/abuse detected, address in-app

---

## Business Model Considerations

**The Paradox:** Success = customer churn (they graduate)

**Marketing angle:** *"An app so good you won't need it."*

This is a feature, not a bug. Position it as proof we're not optimizing for addiction/engagement like other apps.

**Pricing thoughts:**
- Factor in natural churn from graduation
- Labor of love energy > growth-at-all-costs
- Consider: single parents, lower-income families (scholarship/sliding scale?)
- Subscription that feels fair given the goal

**To figure out:**
- Free tier scope
- What's worth paying for
- How to sustain if customers successfully leave

---

## Research Foundation (CRITICAL)

**See full research document: `/docs/RESEARCH.md`**

Our approach is grounded in actual research, not just opinions. Every major design decision is referenceable.

### Research Summary

| Our Decision | Research Basis |
|--------------|----------------|
| Growth XP, not spendable points | Kohn (rewards undermine), SDT (autonomy) |
| Personal progress, not leaderboards | Gamification meta-analysis (anxiety/jealousy risk) |
| Bounce-back celebration | Resilience research (dopamine on return, not streak) |
| Built-in rest days | Emotional Decay Curve (prevents shame spiral) |
| Process praise ("you kept trying") | Dweck (20-30% performance improvement) |
| Optional journaling | Child Mind Institute (as effective as CBT) |
| Privacy by default for journals | Journaling research (trust required for honesty) |
| Explain the "why" of tasks | SDT (supports internalization), Kohn (content) |
| Gradual scaffolding → fading | SDT internalization research |
| Success = kid graduates | Intrinsic motivation as explicit end goal |

### Key Sources (Researched)
- **Self-Determination Theory** (Deci & Ryan) - Autonomy, competence, relatedness
- **Carol Dweck** - Growth mindset, praise process not talent
- **Alfie Kohn** - Rewards undermine intrinsic motivation
- **Gamification meta-analyses** - When it helps (feedback, progress) vs. harms (competition, anxiety)
- **Resilience research** - Bounce-back > never-miss, self-compassion
- **Journaling research** - Effective for anxiety/depression in adolescents

### Still To Research
- Russell Barkley on ADHD and executive function
- Kazdin's parent management training
- Behavioral economics (nudge theory, loss aversion in kids)
- Avatar/identity development in adolescents

## Competitive Landscape

### The Market Buckets

Most competitors fall into one of three categories:

```
MONEY-FOCUSED                 TASK COMPLETION              BEHAVIOR/ADHD
─────────────────             ─────────────────            ─────────────────
Greenlight                    ChoreMonster                 Joon ⭐
BusyKid                       OurHome (dead?)
FamZoo                        Cozi
GoHenry/Acorns Early          Homey (stale?)

"Chores = earn money"         "Gamify chores"              "Help struggling kids"
Financial literacy focus      Points/badges/rewards        Therapeutic angle
Debit cards, investing        Task management              Virtual pet/game
Ages 8-18                     All ages                     Ages 6-12
```

### Key Competitors Deep Dive

**Joon** - Closest competitor
- Ages 6-12 (younger than us)
- ADHD/executive function focus
- Virtual pet (Doter) you care for by completing tasks
- 90% task completion rate claimed
- $12.99/mo or $89.99/yr
- Backed by therapists/pediatricians
- **Gap:** Ends at age 12, heavy extrinsic motivation (pet), doesn't aim for graduation

**Greenlight** - Market leader in family finance
- Debit card for kids, $4.99-14.98/mo
- Chores tied to allowance
- Investing for teens
- **Gap:** Money-focused, not development-focused

**BusyKid** - Chores + money management
- $4/mo for 5 kids
- Spend/Save/Share buckets
- Auto-docks "taxes" - realistic
- **Gap:** Utilitarian, no development philosophy

**FamZoo** - OG (since 2006)
- Virtual family bank
- Most flexible, budget-friendly
- **Gap:** Old-school, no gamification, no development angle

**ChoreMonster** - Classic gamification
- Points, badges, rewards
- Parents set rewards kids can "buy"
- **Gap:** Pure extrinsic motivation, exactly what we're NOT doing

### Where Treehouse Fits

                         │                               │
                    TASK FOCUS ◄─────────────────► DEVELOPMENT FOCUS
```

### Our Differentiation

| Them | Us |
|------|-----|
| Success = tasks completed | Success = kid graduates from app |
| Chores → Money | Chores → Growth |
| Ages 6-12 or all ages | Ages 10-16 (device-owning) |
| Parent surveillance | Kid agency + parent insight |
| Generic gamification | Research-grounded philosophy |
| Engagement optimization | Healthy relationship with app |
| Virtual rewards | Real skill development |

### Positioning Statement (Draft)

**Lead:** *"Less on chores, more on character."*

**Alternatives:**
- "Other apps reward your kids for doing chores. Treehouse helps them become people who don't need rewards."
- "The family app designed to make itself obsolete."
- "From points to purpose."
- "Build humans, not habits."

---

## Inspiration

- **Duolingo**: Streaks, but needs forgiveness
- **BuildLegends**: Parent-child development, but we use life as curriculum
- **RPG games**: Stats, leveling, but growth is real not virtual
- **Joon**: ADHD gamification, but we go older + aim for intrinsic
- **Self-Determination Theory**: Autonomy, competence, relatedness
- **Growth Mindset (Dweck)**: Effort > talent, learning from failure
